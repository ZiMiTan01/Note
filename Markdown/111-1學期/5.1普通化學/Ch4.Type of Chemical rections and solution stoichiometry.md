## 4.2 Electrolyte

* Electric condnctivity the abilty to conduct an electric current.
  1. Stong electrolyte:
    A cpd easuly is dissolves in $H_2O$

    $$NaCl\to Na^++Cl^-$$

    $$HCl\to H^++Cl^-$$

    $$NaOH\to Na^++OH^-$$

  2. Weak electrolytes:
    Weak electrolytes are substantes that product relatively few ions when dissoved in $H_2O$ , Ex:Weak acid.

   $$CH_3COOH\to CH_3COO+H^+$$

  3. Non-electrolyte:
    The substantes dissoved in $H_2O$ can't product any ions, Ex. $C_2H_5OH$ in $H_2O$ .

## 4.3 Solution Composition

Molarity( $M$ ) is defined as mole of solute per volume of solution and used in solution calculate.

$$M=\frac{\text{Moles of solute}}{\text{Liter of solution}}$$

> * Ex: Calculate $Na^+$ ion concentration in $0.07L$ , $3M$ $Na_2CO_3$ solution.
>
>> $$Na_2CO_3\to 2Na^++CO_3^{2-}$$
>>
>> $$0.07\times 3=0.21(mole)$$
>>
>> $$\therefore [Na^+]=0.21\times 2=0.42(mole)$$
>>
>> $$NaHCO_3\to Na^++HCO_3^-$$
>>
>> $$[Na^+]=0.03\times 1 =0.03(mole)$$
>>
>> $$[Na^+]=\frac{0.03+0.42}{0.03+0.07}=\frac{0.45}{0.1}=4.5M$$

### $ppm$ and $ppb$

* a. $5ppb$ $Hg$ in $H_2O$
   $$\text{ppb of Hg in }H_2O=\frac{5\times 10^{-9}g\cdot Hg}{1mL\cdot Hg}$$

   $$[Hg]=\frac{\dfrac{5\times 10^{-9}}{200\cdot 6}mol}{10^{-3}L}=2.5\times 10^{-8}M$$
* b. $10ppm$ $As$ in $H_2O$
   $$\text{ppm of As in }H_2O=\frac{10\times 10^{-6}g}{1 mL}$$

   $$\therefore[As]=\frac{\dfrac{10\times 10^{-6}}{73}mol}{1mL\cdot H_2O}$$

## 4.5 Precipitate reaction

An insolnble substance forms when two solutions are mixed, The solid is called precipitate.

$$K_2CrO_{4(aq)}+Ba(NO_3)_{2(aq)}\to BaCrO_{4(s)}+2KNO_{3(aq)}$$

### 例題1

How many grams of Silver Chloride can be prepared by the reaction of $100mL$ of $0.2M$ sliver nitrate with $100mL$ of $0.15M$ Calcium Chloride?
FM of $AgCl=143$

$$
\begin{split}
  &\quad 2AgNO_3 \quad +\quad CaCl_2 \qquad \to \qquad 2AgCl\quad +\quad Ca(NO_3)\quad \\
    &\begin{array}{cc}
      +2\times 10^{-2} \quad & +1.5\times 10^{-2} \qquad & \quad & \qquad& \\
      -2\times 10^{-2} \quad & -1\times 10^{-2} \qquad & \quad 2\times 10^{-2} \quad & \quad &  \\
      \hline
      0 \quad & \quad 0.5\times 10^{-2} \qquad & \quad 2\times 10^{-2} \quad &
    \end{array}
\end{split}
$$

$$\therefore W_{AgCl}=2\times 10^{-2}\times 243=2.86g$$

### 例題2

What mass of $Na_2CrO_4$ is required to precipitate all of the sliver ions form $75mL$ of a $0.1m$ solution of $AgNO_3$ ?
FM of $Na_2CrO_4=162$

$$Na_2CrO_4+2AgNO_3\to Ag_2CrO_4+2NaNO_3$$

$\dfrac{1}{2}\times 7.5 \times 10^{-3}$ mole for $Na_2CrO_4$ is required.
$\Rightarrow \text{Mass}=3.75\times 10^-3\times 162=0.607g$

## 4.9 Acid-Base reaction

$$
\begin{cases}
  \text{An acid is proton }(p^+)\text{ donor Ex: }HCl \\
  \text{An base is }p^+\text{ acceptor Ex: }NaOH \\
\end{cases} \Rightarrow H^{+}_{(aq)}+OH^-_{(aq)}\to H_2O_{(l)}
$$

* For strong acid and base

  $$HCl+KOH\to H_2O+NaCl$$

* For strong base and weak acid

  $$OH^-+HC_2H_3O\to H_2O+C_2H_3O_2^-$$

### 例題

What volume of a $0.1M$ $HCl$ is need to neutralize $25mL$ of $0.35M$ $NaOH$ solution?

$$HCl+NaOH\to H_2O+NaCl$$

  $$0.35M\times 0.025L=8.75\times 10^{-3}mol$$

  $$\therefore \frac{8.75\times 10^{-3}}{0.1M}=87.5mL$$

### 例題

A $0.5L$ $H_2SO_4$ solution was analyzed by taking a $100mL$ aliquout and adding $50mL$ of $0.213M$ $NaOH$. After the reaction occured, an excee of $OH^-$ ions of $0.103M$ , $13.21mL$ $HCl$ , Calculate the molarity $(M)$ of $H_2SO_4$ .

$$
\begin{array}{cc}
  \text{Orginal } H_2SO_4 & \leftarrow NaOH\to & HCl \\
  \hline
  100mL & 50mL & 13.21mL \\
  C_M & 0.213M & 0.103M \\
\end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{split}
  \therefore \text{ or}&\text{ign }H^+ \text{ from }H_2SO_4=NaOH-HCl \\
  \Rightarrow &50\times 10^{-3}\times 0.213 -13.21 \times 10^{-3}\times 0.103 \\
  =& 9.29\times 10^{-3} mol
\end{split}
$$

$$\because H_2SO_4\to 2H^++SO^{2-}_4$$

$$
\begin{split}
  \therefore [H_2SO_4]=&\frac{1}{2}[H^+] \\
  =&\frac{9.29\times 10^{-3}mol}{0.1L}\times \frac{1}{2}=0.0464M
\end{split}
$$

## 4.10 Oxidation-Reduction Reactions

Reaction in which one or more $e^-$ 's are transfered, are called Oxidation-Reduction reactions.
>
> $$2Na_{(s)}+Cl_{2(g)}\to 2NaCl_{(s)}$$

* Oxidation state: attract $e^-$ 's power.

  $$F>O>N\approx Cl$$

  > $F$ has Greatest attraction for $e^-$ , and the $Cl$ has Least attraction for $e^-$.

### Rule for assigning Oxidation number

1. The oxidation state of an atom in an element is $0$.
   > For example, the oxidation state of each atom in the substances $Na_{(s)}$ $O_{2(g)}$ , $O_{3(g)}$ and $Hg_{(l)}$ is $0$.

2. The oxidation state of a monatomic ion is the same as its charge.
   > For example, the oxidation state of the $Na^+$ ion is $+1$ .

3. In its covalent compounds with non-metals, hydrogen $(H)$ is assigned an oxidation state of $+1$.
   > For example, in the compounds $HCl$, $NH_{2}$ , $H_2O$ and $CH_{4}$ hydrogen is assigned an oxidation state of $+1$.

4. Oxygen is $-2$ in its covalent compounds.
   >such as $CO$ , $CO_{2}$ , $SO_{2}$ and $SO_{3}$ .

   The exception in peroxides (compounds containing the ${O_{2}}^{2-}$ group), where each oxygen is assigned an oxidation state of $-1$.
   > Ex: hydrogen peroxide $(H_{2}O_{2})$ , ${O_{2}}^{2-}$

5. In binary compounds, the element with the greater attraction for the electrons in the bond is assigned a negative oxidation state equal to its charge in its ionic compounds.
   > For example, fluorine $(F^{-})$ is always assigned an oxidation state of $-1$ .

   That is, for purposes of counting electrons, fluorine is assumed to be $F^-$ Nitrogen is usually assigned $N^{3-}$ .
   > For example, $NH_{3}$ nitrogen $(N)$ is assigned an oxidation state of $-3$ , $H_{2}S$ sulfur $(S)$ is assigned an oxidation state of $-2$ ; $HI$ , iodine $(I)$ is assigned an oxidation state of $-1$ .

6. The sum of the oxidation states must be zero for an electrically neutral compound and must be equal to the overall charge for an ionic species.
   > For example, the sum of the oxidation states for the hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water is 0; the sum of the oxidation states for the carbon and oxygen atoms in ${CO_3}^{2-}$ is $-2$ ; and the sum of oxidation states for the nitrogen and hydrogen atoms in ${NH_4}^+$ is $+1$.
