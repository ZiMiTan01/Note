In this chapter, the coverage of the electromagnetic **spectrum(光譜)** leads to electromagnetic strncture of atoms. From this information, we can rationalize and predict such properties of atom as size.

## Electromagnetic radiation

* Electromagnetic radiation have wave-like behavior and travel at the speed of light in a vaccum, such as microwave and x-ray.
* Elevtromagnetic radiation is so-named because it has electrical and magnetic field that simutaneously oscillate in planes perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation through space.
* Wave are characterized by wavelength, frequency, and speed.
  >
  > * wavelength (Greek tetter lambda, $\lambda$ ): The distance between two consecutive peaks or through in a wave.
  > * frequency (Greek letter nu, $\mu$ ): The number of waves per second that pass a given point space.

## Dualnature of light

* Louis de Brogiie's equation

  $$\lambda=\frac{h}{mv}$$

  > $\lambda$ :particle
  > $m$ :mass wavelength
  > $v$ :velocity

## The Atomic spectrum of hydrogen

A continuoms apectrum: All the wavelengths over which the spectrum is continuoms, such as light spectrum.
line spectrum: specific wavelength that are charactteristic of the substance emitting those wavelengths, such as hydrogen atom spectrum.
This indicates that only certain energies are allowed for the $e^-$ in the hydrogen atom and anergy of the $e^-$ in hydrogen atom is quantized.

## The Bohr Model

In 1913, a Danish physicist, Niels Bohr developed quantum model for Hydrogen atom.
This model describe that $e^-$ in a Hydrogen atom moves around the nucleus only in certain allowed circular orbits.

* Two important point about the Bohr model
  1. The model correctly fits the quantized energy levels of the Hydrogen atom as inferred from its emission spectrum
These -energy levels correspond to Certain allowed circular orbits for the $e^-$ s.
  2. As the e become more tightly bound, its energy becomes more negative relative to the zero-energy refenence state.

## Quantum Mechanics description of atom

For és motion in Hydrogen atom, Bohr's Model is not exactly. The revised model by de Broglie and Schrödinger(薛丁格). was developed.

* Model:
  The $e^-$ bound to the nucleus seemed similar to a standing wave.
