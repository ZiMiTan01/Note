## Electromagnetic radiation

* Electromagnetic radiation have wave-like behavior and travel at the speed of light in a vaccum, such as microwave and x-ray.
* Elevtromagnetic radiation is so-named because it has electrical and magnetic field that simutaneously oscillate in planes perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation through space.
* Wave are characterized by wavelength, frequency, and speed.
  >
  > * wavelength (Greek tetter lambda, $\lambda$ ): The distance between two consecutive peaks or through in a wave.
  > * frequency (Greek letter nu, $\nu$ ): The number of waves per second that pass a given point space.

## Dual nature of light

All electromagnetic field exhibits both particulate and wave properties.

* **Planck's experiment (German, $\gamma$ )**
  Planck found that energy can be gained or lost only in whole-number multiples of quantity $hv$

  $$\Delta=nh \nu$$

  > $h$ :Planck's constant $=6.626\times 10^{-34}(J)$
  >
  > $\nu$ :frequency
  >
  > $n=1, 2, 3, 4\dotsc \text{integer}$

  The energy of electromagnetic field is discontinuous. The energy is "quantized" and can be transferred in units of $h \nu$ . Each of these small "packets" of energy is called a quantum.

* **Einstein's photoeletric effect**

  The photoelectric effect is the phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from the surface of a metal when light strikes it.
  Einstein suggested electromagnetic radiation can be viewed as a stream of "particles" called photons.

  $$E_{photon}=h\nu=\dfrac{hc}{\lambda}$$

  So, according to the work of planck and Einstein:
    1. Energy is quantized. It can be transferred only in discrete units called quanta.
    2. Electromagnetic radiation have bot particulate and Wave properties.

* **Louis de Brogiie's equation**
  $$\lambda=\frac{h}{mv}$$

### 例題

$Na$ atom  a characteristic yellow color when excited in a flame. The color comes from the memission of light of 589. o um.

1. What is the fiequency of this radiation?

   $$
   \begin{split}
    \nu=\frac{c}{\lambda}=\frac{2.99\times 10^8 (m/s)}{5.89\times 10^{-7} (m)}=5.09\times 10^{14} s^{-1}
   \end{split}
   $$

2. What is energy of this radiation per photon? Per mole of photon?

   $$
   \begin{split}
    \Delta E=h\nu =&6.6\times 10^{-34} (J\cdot s) \times 5.09\times 10^{14} (s^{-1}) \\
    =&3.37\times 10^{-19}J
   \end{split}
   $$

   $$
   \begin{split}
    \therefore \text{For 1 mole  photon}=&3.373\times 10^{-19}J\times 6.022\times 10^{23} \\

## The Atomic spectrum of Hydrogen

* **A continuoms apectrum(連續光譜)**
  All the wavelengths over which the spectrum is continuoms, such as light spectrum.
* **line spectrum(線譜)**
  specific wavelength that are charactteristic of the substance emitting those wavelengths, such as hydrogen atom spectrum.

This indicates that only certain energies are allowed for the $e^-$ in the hydrogen atom and anergy of the $e^-$ in hydrogen atom is quantized.

## The Bohr Model

In 1913, a Danish physicist, Niels Bohr developed quantum model for Hydrogen atom.
This model describe that $e^-$ in a Hydrogen atom moves around the nucleus only in certain allowed circular orbits.

* Two important point about the Bohr model
  1. The model correctly fits the quantized energy levels of the Hydrogen atom as inferred from its emission spectrum.
  These -energy levels correspond to Certain allowed circular orbits for the $e^-$ s.
  2. As the $e^-$ becomes more tightly bound, its energy becomes more negative relative to the zero-energy refenence state.

### 例題

Calculate the energy change corresponding to the excitation of an electron from the $n=1$ to $n=3$ electronic state in the $H$ atom.

* Ans

  $$\begin{split}
    \Delta E=&E_{final}-E_{initial}=E_3-E_1 \\
    =&-2.178\times 10^{-18}\times (\frac{1^2}{3^2}-\frac{1^2}{1^2}) \\
    =&1.936\times 10^{-18} J
  \end{split}
  $$

  "Positive" mean energy was absobed to excitc the $e^-$ .

### 例題

What wavelength of electromagnetic radiation is associated with the energy change in promoting an electron from n=1 to n=3 level in the $H$ atom?

$$\Delta E=\frac{hc}{\lambda}\Rightarrow \lambda=\frac{hc}{\Delta E}$$

$$\lambda =\frac{6.626\times 10^{-34}\times 2.99\times 10^8}{1.936\times 10^{-18}}=1.026\times 10^{-7}m =102.6 nm$$

## Quantum Mechanics description of atom

For $e^-$ s motion in Hydrogen atom, Bohr's Model is not exactly. The revised model by de Broglie and Schrödinger(薛丁格) was developed.

* Model:
  The $e^-$ bound to the nucleus seemed similar to a standing wave.

<div align=center><img src=./Picture/112-3-6/IMG20230306_E.jpg width=50%><img src=./Picture/112-3-6/IMG20230306_F.jpg width=40%></div>

* Schrödinger Equation(薛丁格方程)

  $$\hat {H}\psi =E\psi$$

  > $\psi$ :量子態

* Heisenberg uncertainty principle
  In 1927, Werner Heisenberg developed "Heisenberg uncertainty principle" for $e^-$ motion and position.
  "This is a fundamental limitation to just how precisly we can know both the position and momentum of a particle ( $e^-$ ) at a given time."

  $$\Delta x \cdot \Delta p\geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$$

  * The smallest uncertainty: $\dfrac{h}{4\pi}$
    This tell us, we can not know exactly where an $e^-$ is around an atom at any given time. We can know the probability of it being within a certain region.

## The particle in a box

Schrödinger developed a function to describe wave-like $e^-$ motion.

* schrödinger's equation

  $$\hat{H}\psi=E\psi$$

  > $\psi$ :Wave function, a function of coordinates $(X,Y,Z)$ . of the $e^-$ 's position in 3D space.
  >
  > $\hat{H}$ :operator, a mathematical tool that acts on a function to produce another function.
  >
  > $E$ = total energy of particle (potential energy $+$ kinetic energy)

Consider а particle ( $e^-$ ) with mass $m$ that is free to move back and forth along one dimension between $X=0$ and $x=L$ .

<div align=center><img src=./Picture/112-3-13/IMG20230313_A.png width=70%></div>

$\hat{H}$ is operator of (potential energy $+$ kinetic energy) $=$ operator of kinetic energy $(\because \text{potential energy} \ V(x)=0)$

$$
\begin{split}
\hat{H}= & \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\cdot \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\
\Rightarrow & \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\cdot \frac{d^2}{dx^2}\psi(x)=E \psi(x) \\
\Rightarrow & \frac{d^2}{dx^2}\psi(x)=\frac{-2mE}{\hbar^2}\psi(x)
\end{split}
$$

> * $m$ :particle's mass
> * 第二式中的 $E$ 是恆定的
> * $\hbar$ is Plank's constant

In order to slove $\dfrac{d^2 \psi(x)}{dx^2}=\text{Constant}\times \psi(x)\Rightarrow \psi(x)$ can be sine function $\Rightarrow \psi(x)=A\sin(kx)$

> $Constant \to A$

$$
\begin{split}
  \because \frac{d^2\psi(x)}{dx^2}=&\frac{d^2}{dx^2}(A\sin kx)=A\frac{d}{dx}(\frac{d\sin kx}{dx})=A\frac{d}{dx}(k\cos kx) \\
  =&Ak(\frac{d\cos kx }{dx})=Ak(-k\sin kx)=-Ak^2\sin kx \\
  =&-k^2A\sin kx \\
\end{split}
$$

$$
\begin{split}
  \therefore \dfrac{d^2A\sin kx}{dx^2}= & \dfrac{-2xE}{\hbar^2}A\sin kx=-k^2A\sin kx \\
  \Rightarrow& -k^2=\dfrac{-2xE}{\hbar^2} \\
  \Rightarrow& E=\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}
\end{split}
$$

> $E=\dfrac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$ (System is quantized)
>
> $2m$ :certain energy
>
> Confirmed with $H$ atom spectrum.

$\psi=A\sin (kx)\quad \text{for}\quad \psi(0)=0 \quad \text{and} \quad \psi(L)=0$

$
\begin{cases}
  \psi(0)=A\sin(0)=0 \\
  \psi(L)=A\sin(kL)=0 \\
\end{cases} \Rightarrow k \text{ most be } \dfrac{n\pi}{L}\quad (n \text{ is quantum number})
$

$$\therefore \psi =A\sin(\frac{n\pi}{L}\cdot x)$$

Let the square of the wave fanction is probability of finding a particle.

Total probability of finding the particle in the box $=\int^L_0 \psi^2(x)=1$

$$\because \psi(x)=A\sin[\frac{n\pi}{L}\cdot x]$$

$$
\begin{split}
  \int^L_0 \psi^2(x)dx & =\int^L_0 A^2\sin^2(\frac{n\pi}{L}\cdot x)dx=1 \\
  &\Rightarrow \int^L_0 \sin^2(\frac{n\pi}{L}\cdot x)dx=\frac{1}{A^2} \\
  &\Rightarrow \frac{L}{2}=\frac{1}{A^2}\Rightarrow A=\sqrt{\frac{2}{L}}
\end{split}
$$

$$\therefore \psi(x)=\sqrt{\frac{2}{L}}\sin (\frac{n\pi}{L}\cdot x)$$

$$\because E=\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}\quad k=\frac{n\pi}{L}\quad \hbar=\frac{h}{2\pi}$$

$$\therefore E=\frac{n^2 h^2}{8mL^2}\quad (n \text{ is quantum number})$$

$$\therefore E_1=\frac{h^2}{8mL^2}\quad E_2=\frac{4h^2}{8mL^2}\quad E_3=\frac{9h^2}{8mL^2}$$
