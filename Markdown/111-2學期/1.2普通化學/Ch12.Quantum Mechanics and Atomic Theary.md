In this chapter, the coverage of the electromagnetic **spectrum(光譜)** leads to electromagnetic strncture of atoms. From this information, we can rationalize and predict such properties of atom as size.

## Electromagnetic radiation

* Electromagnetic radiation have wave-like behavior and travel at the speed of light in a vaccum, such as microwave and x-ray.
* Elevtromagnetic radiation is so-named because it has electrical and magnetic field that simutaneously oscillate in planes perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation through space.

Wave are characterized by wavelength, frequency
