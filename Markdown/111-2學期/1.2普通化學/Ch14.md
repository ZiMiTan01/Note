## Hybridization and the Localized Electron Model

A double bond consists of one bond, where the electron pair is located directly between the atoms, and one IT bond, where the shared
pair ocupies space above and below the bond.

## The Molecular orbital modal

The localized electron model does an excellent job of predicting and justifying molecular shapes. Here, the molecular orbital (Mo) model give a view of $e^-s$ in a molecule that allows us to get a clearer understanding.

* Aproximate treatment of $H_2$
  * $MO_1=1_{SA}+1_{SB}$
  * $MO_2=1_{SA}-1_{SB}$

1. The electron probability of both $MOs$ is centered along the line passing through the two nuclei.
For $MO_1$ , the greatest electron probability is be- tween the nuclei. In this case the matching phases of the orbitals produce constructive interference and enhanced electron probability between the two nuclei.
For $MO_2$ , it is centered along the molecular axis but outside the area between the two nuclei. In this case the mismatched phases produce destructive interference leading to a node in the electron probability between the two nuclei.
This type of cylindrically symmetric electron distribution is described as sigma ( $\sigma$ ), as in the localized electron model,Accordingly, we refer to $MO_1$ and $MO_2$ as sigma ( $\sigma$ ) **$MOs$**.

2. In the molecule, only the MOS are available for occupation by electrons. The 1s atomic orbitals of the hydrogen atoms no longer exist because the H₂ molecule-a new entity-has its own set of new orbitals.

3. MO, is lower in energy than the 1s orbitals of free hydrogen atoms, but MO2 is higher in energy than the 1s orbitals. If the two electrons (one from each hydrogen atom) occupy the lower energy MO, they will have lower energy than they have in the two separate hydrogen atoms.
This is the reason for the stability of $H_2$ molecule.
So bonding MO is lower in energy than the atomic orbitals of which it is composed.
4. For antibonding $MO$ , the $e's$ are ourside space between the nuclei. This type of distribution is not expected to provide any bonding force.
5. Energy diagram

   $$
   \begin{cases}
    MO_1=\sigma_{1s} \\
    MO_2={\sigma_{1s}}^*\\
   \end{cases}
   $$

6. Since the H2 molecule has two electrons in the 01s molecular orbital, the electron configuration is ${\sigma_{1s}}^2$.
7. Each MO can hold two electrons, but the electrons' spins must be opposite.
8. Bond order is a measure of bond strength and net bonding interactions.

  $$B.O.=\frac{\text{鍵結電子數}-\text{反鍵結電子數}}{2}$$

  > * Ex: $H_2$
  >   $H_2$ has 2 bonding $e^-s$ , and no antibonding $e^-s$ ,so The B.O. is 1
  >
  >   $$B.O.=\frac{2-0}{2}=1$$

9. Bond order must be greater than molecule to form.
10. The higher the Bond Order, the stronger the bond.

## Bonding in Homonuclear Diatomic Molecules

To participate in molecular orbitals, atomic orbitals must overlap in space.
