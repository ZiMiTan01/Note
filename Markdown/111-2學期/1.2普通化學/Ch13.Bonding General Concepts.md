## Types of Chemical bonds

### Bond

  The force that hold groups of atoms together and make the atoms function as a unit. Bonds form because the energy of the system is lower than if bonds did not form.

* Ionic bonding

  Ionic bonding is due to electrostatic attraction. It results from the loss an $e^-$ from an alkaline or alkaline earth metal and its gain by a non-metal. Ex $Na^+Cl^-$
  The ionic energy of interaction between a pair of ions can be calculated by using coulomb's law.

  $$V=\frac{Q_1Q_2}{4 \pi \Sigma _0 r}=2.31\times10^{-19}(J \cdot nm)\times(\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r})$$

  > $V$ : Joule
  >
  > $r$ : the distance between the ion centers $(nm)$
  >
  > $Q_1Q_2$ : ionic charges
  >
  > $\Sigma_0$ : permittivity of Vaccum.

#### 例題1

Calculate the ionic energy of interaction (in $kJ/mol$ ) between $Hg^{2+}$ and $O^{2-}$ if the distance between the centers of $Hg^{2+}$ and $O^{2-}$ is $0.205 (nm)$ ,

* **Ans**

  $$
  \begin{split}
   E=&2.31\times10^{-19}(J \cdot nm)\times(\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r}) \\
   =&2.31\times 10^{-19}\times \frac{+2\times -2}{0.205} \\
   =&4.51\times 10^{-21} \quad kJ/\text{ion pair}
  \end{split}
  $$

  $$
  \begin{split}
   \therefore \text{For 1 mole ion pair}\Rightarrow E=&-4.51\times 10^{-21}\times 6.02\times 10^{23} \\
   =&-2710 \quad kJ/mol \\
  \end{split}
  $$

  > For comparing with energy of $NaCl=-504 \dfrac{kJ}{mol}$

* Covalent bonding

  Covalent bonding occurs when bonds form between similar kinds of atoms for the same reason as between dissimilar atoms- the energy of the system is lowered as a result of the Bond formation, Electrons are shared by both nuclei equally.

  <div align=center><img src=.\Picture\112-3-20\IMG_20240318_155107.jpg alt=\ width=50%></div>

  1. Bond length
     The distance at which the energy is minimum is called the equilibrium internuclear distance or bond length.

  2. The energy term involved are potential energy that results from the attractions and repulsions among the charged particles and the kinetic energy.

  3. A very short distances, the energy rises steeply because of the great importance of the internuclear repulsive force at these distances.

  4. The zero reference point for energy is defined for the atoms at infinite separation.

  5. The band energy correspondsto the depth of the "well" at this distance.
     > well指的是"井"的深度

* A polar covalent bond

  Charges are not distributed equally in a molecule (unequal sharing of $e^-$ s).

  > Ex: $C-Cl$ or $H-Cl$

  The nature of the bond will depend upon the ability of each atom in the bond to attract electrons to itself. This is called "electronegativity" .

  > electronegativity: 電負度
  
  The degree of ionic character of a bond can be described by bond energy, The move the electrostatic interacttion that occurs between two atoms, the greater will be the difference in bond energies $\Delta$ .
  
  The greater the $\Delta$ , the more ionic character the bond has.
  If $\Delta=0$ , the boud is perfectly covalent.

#### 例題

Calculate the $\Delta$ for each bonds.

1. $NaCl, Na=0.9, Cl=3$

   $$\Delta=3-0.9=2.1$$

2. $LiH, Li=1, H=2.1$

   $$\Delta=2.1-1=1.1$$

3. $C-H, H=2.1, C=2.5$

   $$\Delta=2.5-2.1=0.4$$

4. $H-F, H=2.1, F=4$

   $$\Delta=4-2.1=1.9$$

5. $Rb-O, Rb=0.8, O=3.5$

   $$\Delta=3.5-0.8=2.7$$

$$\therefore H-C< Li-H< H-F< NaCl< RbO$$

> $H-C$ more calvalent
>
> $RbO$ more ionic

## Bonding Polarity and Dipole moments

It is possible to determine the polarity of a bond by the $\Delta$. If a molecule is diatomic, there is often only one bond, and that will determine whether the molecule is polar,

<div align=center><img src=.\Picture\112-3-20\IMG_20240415_AB.jpg alt=/ width=20%></div>

### 範例：Dipole moments

Show the orientation of the dipole moment of $CHCl_s$ .

1. look up the electronegativity of each atom.

2. Draw the molecule in 3D space.

3. Determine the polarity it each bond and net polarity on each atom.

4. Draw the dipoles and determine the direction of the molecule dipole moment.
   $C=2.5, H=2.1, Cl=3$

2. $N\equiv N \Rightarrow$ No dipole moment $(\Delta=0)$

## Ions: Electron configurations and sizes

Atoms that form bonds in stable compounds have a noble gas electronic configuration.

### 範例

Write the electronic configuration, and determine the charge.

1. $Mg: 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2$

   It loses two is electrons to have the electronic configuration of neon.

   $\therefore Mg^{2+}: 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6$

2. $P\Rightarrow P^{3-}: 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6=[Ar]$
3. $Br\Rightarrow Br^-: 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^2 3d^{10} 4p^6=[Kr]$
4. $Rb\Rightarrow Rb^+: 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^2 3d^{10} 4p^6=[Kr]$

   To determine the formula of binary ionic compound, remeber that chemical compounds, are electrically neutral.

### 範例

* $Mg^{2+} +2Cl^-\to MgCl_2$
  1. As we go down a group, ion size increase, (high energy levels have a larger avergre distance).
  2. Because the ratio of protons to electrons become greater, cations are smaller than their neutral atoms.
  3. Because of electron-electron ropulsion and more effective Shielding, anions are always larger than their neutral atoms. The large the change, the more pronounced the effect.

### 範例

$$S^{2-}>S$$

$$Ca^{2+}<Ca$$

$$S^{2-}>Ca^{2+}$$

### 範例

$$Mg^{2+}<Na^+<F^-<O^{2-}$$

> $Mg^{2+}$ more smallest
> $O^{2-}$ more largest

## Calculating lattice energy

* lattice energy : The energy released when an ionic solid is formed from its gaseous ions.

### 範例

Process must occur

1. $K_{(s)}\to K_{(g)}$ (Energy of sublimation $=64kJ$ )
2. $K_{(g)}\to {K^+}_{(g)}$ ( $I_1=419kJ$ )
3. $\frac{1}{2}Cl_2\to Cl_{(g)}$ (Bond energy $\times \frac{1}{2}=120kJ$ )
4. $Cl_{(g)}\to {Cl^-}_{(g)}$ (Electron affinity $=-349kJ$ )
5. ${K^+}_{(g)}+{Cl^-}_{(g)}\to KCl_{(s)}$ (lattice energy $=-690kJ$ )

$$\therefore \Delta H^\degree_f=64+419+120-349-690=-436kJ$$

Ionic compound forms because its energy is lower then if its elements remained separated.

## Covalent bond energies and chemical reactions

The table gives avergre bond energies for many covalent bonds.

<div align=center><img src=Picture\112-3-27\IMG_20240529_A.jpg width=40% alt=/></div>

Notic that multiple bonds reguire more energy to break than single bonds.

$$\Delta H=\sum D_{\text{ Bond broken}}-\sum D_{\text{ Bonds formed}}$$

> $\Delta H>0\Rightarrow$ endothermic
> $\Delta H<0\Rightarrow$ exothermic
>> $\Delta H=$ Heat of reaction
>> $D=$ Bond energy per moles of bonds

### 例題

Calculate $\Delta H$ .

$$CH_{4(g)}+4F_{2(g)}\to CF_{4(g)}+4HF_{(g)}$$

* Solution

  $$
  \begin{array}{c|c|c}
   \text{Bond broken} & \text{Energy per bond}(kJ) & \text{total} \\
   \hline
   4C-H & 413\times 4 \text{bonds} & 1652kJ \\
   4F-F & 154\times 4 \text{bonds} & 616kJ \\
   \hline
   \qquad & \qquad & 2268kJ
  \end{array}
  $$

  $$
  \begin{array}{c|c|c}
   \text{Bond formed} & \text{Energy per bond}(kJ) & \text{total} \\
   \hline
   4C-F & 485\times 4 \text{bonds} & 1940kJ \\
   4H-F & 565\times 4 \text{bonds} & 2260 kJ \\
   \hline
   \quad & \quad & 4200kJ
  \end{array}
  $$

  $$\therefore \Delta H=2268-4200=-1932kJ\Rightarrow \text{exothermic}$$

## Localized electron bonding model

This model assumes that a molecule is composed of atoms that are bound together by using atomic orbitals to share electron pairs. The electron pairs in the molecule are assumed to be localized on a particular atom or in the space between two atoms.
>
> * lone pairs: Those pairs ofthe locatived on an atom.
> * bonding pairs: $e^-$ pairs are formed in the space between the atoms.

1. Description of the valence è arrangement in the molecule using Lewis structures.
2. Prediction of the geometry of the molecule, using the valence shell electron pair repulsion (USEPR) model.
3. Description of the types of atomic orbitals used by the atoms to share es or hold lone pairs.

## Lewis structures

Lewis structure often are used to depict banding pairs and lone pairs in molecules.

### 範例
