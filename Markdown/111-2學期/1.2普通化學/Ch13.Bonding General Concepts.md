## Types of Chemical bonds

### Bond

  The force that hold groups of atoms together and make the atoms function as a unit. Bonds form because the energy of the system is lower than if bonds did not form.

* Ionic bonding

  Ionic bonding is due to electrostatic attraction. It results from the loss an $e^-$ from an alkaline or alkaline earth metal and its gain by a non-metal. Ex $Na^+Cl^-$
  The ionic energy of interaction between a pair of ions can be calculated by using coulomb's law.

  $$V=\frac{Q_1Q_2}{4 \pi \Sigma _0 r}=2.31\times10^{-19}(J \cdot nm)\times(\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r})$$

  > $V$ : Joule
  >
  > $r$ : the distance between the ion centers $(nm)$
  >
  > $Q_1Q_2$ : ionic charges
  >
  > $\Sigma_0$ : permittivity of Vaccum.

#### 例題1

Calculate the ionic energy of interaction (in $kJ/mol$ ) between $Hg^{2+}$ and $O^{2-}$ if the distance between the centers of $Hg^{2+}$ and $O^{2-}$ is $0.205 (nm)$ ,

* **Ans**

  $$E=2.31\times10^{-19}(J \cdot nm)\times(\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r})=2.31\times 10^{-19}\times \frac{+2\times -2}{0.205}=4.51\times 10^{-21} kJ/\text{ion pair}$$

  $$\therefore \text{For 1 mole ion pair}\Rightarrow E=-4.51\times 10^{-21}\times 6.02\times 10^{23}=-2710 kJ/mol$$

  > For comparing with energy of $NaCl=-504 \dfrac{kJ}{mol}$

* Covalent bonding

  Covalent bonding occurs when bonds form between similar kinds of atoms for the same reason as between dissimilar atoms- the energy of the system is lowered as a result of the Bond formation, Electrons are shared by both nuclei equally.

  1. Bond length
  
     The distance at which the energy is minimum is called the equilibrium internuclear distance or bond length.
     
  2. The energy term involved are potential energy that results from the attractions and repulsions among the charged particles and the kinetic energy.
  3. A very short distances, the energy rises steeply because of the great importance of the internuclear repulsive force at these distances.
  4. The zero reference point for energy is defined for the atoms at infinite separation.
  5. The band energy correspondsto the depth of the "well" at this distance.
     > well指的是"井"的深度

* A polar covalent bond

  Charges are not distributed equally in a molecule (unequal sharing of $e^-$ s).

  > Ex: $C-Cl$ or $H-Cl$

  The nature of the bond will depend upon the ability of each atom in the bond to attract electrons to itself. This is called "electronegativity" .
  
  The degree of ionic character of a bond can be described by bond energy, The move the electrostatic interacttion that occurs between two atoms, the greater will be the difference in bond energies $\Delta$ .
  
  The greater the $\Delta$ , the more ionic character the bond has.
  If $\Delta=0$ , the boud is perfectly covalent.

#### 例題

Calculate the $\Delta$ for each bonds.

1. $NaCl, Na=0.9, Cl=3$

   $$\Delta=3-0.9=2.1$$

2. $LiH, Li=1, H=2.1$

   $$\Delta=2.1-1=1.1$$

3. $C-H, H=2.1, C=2.5$

   $$\Delta=2.5-2.1=0.4$$

4. $H-F, H=2.1, F=4$

   $$\Delta=4-2.1=1.9$$

5. $Rb-O, Rb=0.8, O=3.5$

   $$\Delta=3.5-0.8=2.7$$
