## Past

當我們談論過去發生的事情時，英文通常會使用三種不同的過去時態：Past tense、Past continuous tense、Past perfect tense。

1. Past tense（過去式）：
   表示過去某個時間或事件發生的動作或狀態。例如：
   * I walked to the store yesterday. (我昨天走到商店了。)
   * She ate dinner at home last night. (她昨晚在家吃了晚餐。)

2. Past continuous tense（過去進行式）：
   表示過去某個時間正在進行的動作。它由"was/were + V-ing"結構組成。例如：
   * I was walking to the store when it started raining. (當下雨開始時，我正在走向商店。)
   * She was watching TV when the phone rang. (當電話響起時，她正在看電視。)

3. Past perfect tense（過去完成式）：
   表示過去某個時間或事件之前已經完成的動作或狀態。它由"had + 過去分詞"結構組成。例如：

   * I had already walked to the store before it started raining. (下雨之前，我已經走到商店了。)
   * She had finished dinner before the guests arrived. (客人到達之前，她已經吃完晚餐了。)
